/**
 * ******
 * IterativeRobot
 *
 * The IterativeRobot class works differently than the SimpleRobot. It has a
 * number of overridable methods that are called over and over while the robot
 * is in one of three states: disabled, autonomous, or teleop.
 *
 * For each state there are three methods that are called, an init method, a
 * periodic method and a continuous method.
 *
 * Init methods (disabledInit, autonomousInit, teleopInit)
 *
 * Called when the corresponding state is first entered. It is possible that the
 * method will be called multiple times depending on the field controls. For
 * example, in some games there is a period between the autonomous and teleop
 * parts of the match were the robots are temporarily disabled while some
 * scoring function happens. This is where you should put your initialization
 * code.
 *
 * Periodic methods (disabledPeriodic, autonomousPeriodic, teleopPeriodic)
 *
 * These are called with each driver station update, approximately every 20 mS.
 * The idea is to put code here that gets values from the driver station and
 * updates the motors. You can read the joysticks and other driverstation inputs
 * more often, but youâ€™ll only get the previous value until a new update is
 * received. By synchronizing with the received updates your program will put
 * less of a load on the cRIO CPU leaving more time for other tasks such as
 * camera processing.
 *
 * Continuous methods (disabledContinuous, autonomousContinuous,
 * teleopContinuous)
 *
 * These methods are called continuously during time the other methods are not
 * being called. Using the continuous methods can easily load down the CPU and
 * prevent other code from running properly, so should be used sparingly.
 *
 * With the Iterative robot your program is organized such that during each call
 * the state of the robot is advanced. For example, if the robot is to drive in
 * a square pattern during the autonomous period, then during each
 * autonomousPeriodic method call the program would keep track of which part of
 * the square it is currently drawing and if it should advance to the next part.
